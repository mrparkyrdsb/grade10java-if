# Boolean Operators

To allow programs to make decisions, we must use the combination of Boolean operators and if statements _(Future Lesson)_.

These operators are binary operators that require a __LEFT OPERAND__ and a __RIGHT OPERAND__. The operator will produce a Boolean result of ```true``` or ```false```.

## Comparison Operators

These operators compare the left and the right operand and return ```true``` if the condition is satisfied.

> let ```x``` be a variable and ```y``` be a variable that contains comparable values

| Operation   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
|```x == y``` | Checks if the values of two operands are equal, if YES: returns ```true```. |
|```x != y``` | Checks if the values of two operands are not equal to each other, if YES: returns ```true```. |
|```x > y```  | Checks if the LEFT operand is greater than the RIGHT operand, if YES: returns ```true```. |
|```x < y```  | Checks if the LEFT operand is less than the RIGHT operand, if YES: returns ```true```. |
|```x >= y``` | Checks if the LEFT operand is greater than OR equal to the RIGHT operand, if YES: returns ```true```. |
|```x <= y``` | Checks if the LEFT operand is less than OR equal to the RIGHT operand, if YES: returns ```true```. |

All the operation above return ```false``` if the condition is not met.

## Logical Operators

Logical Operators are used to combine boolean expressions.

### Logical AND Operator: ```&&```

In Java, multiple boolean expressions can be combined by the ```&&``` operator. 

This operator returns ```true``` if both sides of the operands evaluate to ```true```. Otherwise it will be ```false```.


__Example Use of the AND operator:__
> If the train is late to the station __AND__ there are no cabs at the station, I am late to work.
```
Their are two boolean conditions:
1. Train is late or not late
2. There are not cabs

The person being late is dependent on BOTH conditions being TRUE. 

The two conditions are combined by a Logical AND operation.
```

### Logical OR Operator: ```||```

In Java, multiple boolean expressions can be combined by the ```||``` operator. 

This operator returns ```true``` if both sides  OR either sides of the operands evaluate to ```true```. It only returns ```false``` if both sides of the operands evaluated to ```false```.

__Example Use of the OR operator:__
> I only snack if I am hungry __OR__ if I am bored.
```
Their are two boolean conditions:
1. Person is hungry
2. Person is bored

The person being late is dependent on EITHER conditions being TRUE OR BOTH conditions being true.

The two conditions are combined by a Logical OR operation.
```

### Logical NOT Operator: ```!```

In Java, ```!``` is used to reverse a boolean expression's boolean result.

| Operation      | Result      |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| ```!(true)```  | ```false``` |
| ```!(false)``` | ```true```  |

__Example Use of the NOT operator:__
> If it is __NOT__ a weekday, I don't go to school
```
The person is dependent on not going to school when it is not a weekday.

On Monday to Friday, the condition of being a weekday is true
    --> Therefore, the "NOT weekday" evaluates to false hench they go to school.

On Saturday & Friday, the condition being a weekday is false
    --> Therefore, the "NOT weekday" evaluates to true hence they don't go to school.
```

## Code Examples on Java
```Java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Boolean Operations in Java.");

        int x = 10;
        int y = 15;

        System.out.println("Is x == y?: " + (x == y));
        System.out.println("Is x != y?: " + (x != y));
        System.out.println("Is x > y?: " + (x > y));
        System.out.println("Is x < y?: " + (x < y));
        System.out.println("Is x >= y?: " + (x >= y));
        System.out.println("Is x <= y?: " + (x <= y));

        int grade = 10;
        int average = 81;

        System.out.println("Are you in grade 10 and have an average higher than or equal to 80?: " + (grade == 10 && average >= 80));

        String fav_fruit = "blueberry";
        System.out.println("Is your favourite fruit blueberry or kiwi?: " + (fav_fruit == "blueberry" || fav_fruit == "kiki"));
        
        boolean weekday = true;
        System.out.println("Do you not go to school today?: " + (!(weekday)));
        
    }
}
```
